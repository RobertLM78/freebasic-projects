#   Installation    #
#####################
Linux 32- and 64-bit and Windows (32-bit) binaries are included in the Git
repository (/bin/ folder).  Each have -x86,-amd64, or .exe respectively.   If
you are unsure which Linux binary you need, download the -x86 version.  These
are ready to use, 'right out of the box', with no other action needed.
(Binaries compiled with FreeBASIC version 1.02.1)

If you are adventurous and would rather compile it yourself, follow these in-
stuctions (assuming you already have the FreeBASIC compiler - version 1.02.1 or
lower is suggested):

Download the source tarball (.tar.gz file) and extract to where ever you would
like to keep the files (Windows users can use 7-zip or a variety of other
utilities to unpack the archive).

Open a terminal (Linux) or command window (Windows) in the folder that was
created extracting the archive (which should be named something like
'GematriaFBC-1.x-src').

To compile on Linux:
fbc ./GematriaFBC.bas

To compile on Windows:
fbc GematriaFBC.bas

#########################
#  Running the Program  #
#########################
Linux:
It is suggested to make a symbolic link to the binary in /home/foo/bin/, that
way the program can be run from anywhere.
Also suggested is to remove the suffix from the binary name (i.e. the '-x86' or
'-amd64'), however it will still work without doing so.  For example:
$ ln -s /home/foo/downloaded/path/GematriaFBC /home/foo/bin/GematriaFBC

Windows:
Double click the .exe or call the program from the command prompt.


Usage:
     -h, --help              Show options
     -v, --version           Show version
     -w, --warranty          Warranty and license conditions
     -l, --log               Log session (as GematriaFBC.log)
     -r, --reverse           Append reversed forms to output
     -V, --verbose           Verbose output


Example, in a shell console type:
GematriaFBC.exe -l -r -V
Which will log the session, give reverse forms, and verbose output.

#########################
#  General Information  #
#########################
Enter a phrase to find the gematria.  Enter !q to quit or !c to clear the
screen.  The maxium allowable entry depends on your console size, with an
'absolute maxium' entry of 127 characters.  Use the ESC button to erase an
entire entry.

Use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through previous entries.  A file named
.GematriaFBC_hist will be created to save the entries.
********************************************************************************
A small bug exists with this scrolling: you must push HOME/END to begin editing
a previous entry that has been fetched with the arrow keys.  I hope to have this
removed soon.
********************************************************************************

As an extra control measure, no leading spaces are allowed in an entry.

The default setting (no reverse option) has the following systems:
Simple (English Ordinal), Regular (Sumerian), Jewish, Satanic, Extended,
Septenary, Chaldean, Pythagorean (Full Reduction), and Reduced.
With the reverse option on the following systems are appended to the output:
Reverse Simple (Reverse Ordinal), Reverse Regular (Reverse Sumerian), and
Reverse Pythagorean (Reverse Full Reduction).

Note that in some Linux (ANSI emulated) terminals, the verbose option comes at a
cost of speed, but will display the entered string and then letter values in a
sum format.  If you're running under Linux, and would like better performance,
switch to a true text-only console (TTY) - or try installing another terminal
emulator.
The following two emulators have shown good performance:
KDE's Konsole
Rox's ROXTerm

# Important Note regarding version 2.0 and newer #
##################################################
As of version 2.0, with it's customized input method, GematriaFBC is, for now,
incompatible with SSH.  Sorry for the inconvenience.  If you need to use this
over SSH, please download version 1.4.1 or earlier from the archive.
