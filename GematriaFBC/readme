#   Installation    #
#####################
Linux 32- and 64-bit and Windows (32-bit) binaries are included in the Git
repository (/bin/ folder).  Each have -x86,-amd64, or .exe respectively.   If
you are unsure which Linux binary you need, download the -x86 version.

Runtime libraries are required.  Most of these are common, and may already be
installed on your system.  For Debian-based Linux distributions, the following
are required:
libc6, libncurses5, libx11-6, libxext6, libxrender1, libxrandr2
For Windows 98+, the following are required:
msvcrt.dll, DirectX 5.0+
The C runtime library msvcrt.dll can be downloaded here:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24417

Debian installers are now available in the /deb/ folder.  Choose the one for
your architecture.  Beyond the required runtime libraries (which are likely
already installed on your system), these packages should work on just about any
Debian-based distribution.  As before, if you are unsure, pick the i386 (x86)
package.

(Binaries compiled with FreeBASIC version 1.02.1)

If you are adventurous and would rather compile it yourself, follow these in-
stuctions (assuming you already have the FreeBASIC compiler - version 1.02.1 or
lower is suggested):

Download the source tarball (.tar.gz file) and extract to where ever you would
like to keep the files (Windows users can use 7-zip or a variety of other
utilities to unpack the archive).

Open a terminal (Linux) or command window (Windows) in the folder that was
created extracting the archive (which should be named something like
'GematriaFBC-1.x-src').

To compile on Linux:
fbc GematriaFBC.bas -x gematriafbc

To compile on Windows:
fbc GematriaFBC.bas -x gematriafbc.exe

#  Running the Program  #
#########################
Linux:
It is suggested to make a symbolic link to the binary in /home/foo/bin/, that
way the program can be run from anywhere.
Also suggested is to remove the suffix from the binary name (i.e. the '-x86' or
'-amd64'), however it will still work without doing so.  For example:
$ ln -s /home/foo/downloaded/path/GematriaFBC /home/foo/bin/GematriaFBC

Windows:
Double click the .exe or call the program from the command prompt.


Usage:
     -h, --help              Show options
     -v, --version           Show version
     -w, --warranty          Warranty and license conditions
     -l, --log               Log session (as GematriaFBC.log)
     -r, --reverse           Append reversed forms to output
     -V, --verbose           Verbose output


Example, in a shell console type:
GematriaFBC.exe -l -r -V
Which will log the session, give reverse forms, and verbose output.  The log is
saved to a relative path, depending on where the program was started.  This will
likely remain for time being, though an absolute path may be introduced, as with
the history file.

#########################
#  General Information  #
#########################
Enter a phrase to find the gematria.  Enter !q to quit or !c to clear the
screen.  The maximum allowable entry depends on your console size, with an
'absolute maximum' entry of 127 characters.  Use the ESC button to erase an
entire entry.

Use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through previous entries.  Previous
entries are saved in a file with the name .GematriaFBC_hist in the user's home
folder. This is now an absolute path, rather than a relative path (i.e., before
version 2.1.2, the history file would be saved to the path from which the
program was called).
So now, for Linux, the path should be something like:
/home/foo/
and for Windows, something *like*:
C:\Documents and Settings\Foo\
 -OR-
C:\Users\Foo\

As an extra control measure, no leading spaces are allowed in an entry.

The default setting (no reverse option) has the following systems:
Simple (English Ordinal), Regular (Sumerian), Jewish, Satanic, Extended,
Septenary, Chaldean, Pythagorean (Full Reduction), and Reduced.
With the reverse option on the following systems are appended to the output:
Reverse Simple (Reverse Ordinal), Reverse Regular (Reverse Sumerian), and
Reverse Pythagorean (Reverse Full Reduction).

Note that in some Linux (ANSI emulated) terminals, the verbose option comes at a
cost of speed, but will display the entered string and then letter values in a
sum format.  If you're running under Linux, and would like better performance,
switch to a true text-only console (TTY) - or try installing another terminal
emulator.
The following two emulators have shown good performance:
KDE's Konsole
X11's urxvt (rxvt)
